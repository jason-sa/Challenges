``` sql
SELECT od.orderid, sum(od.quantity * p.price)

7. Which employee made the most sales (by total price)?

``` sql
SELECT e.employeeid, e.firstname, e.lastname, sum(od.quantity * p.price)
FROM [Orders] as o
INNER JOIN employees as e
    ON o.employeeid = e.employeeid
INNER JOIN orderdetails as od
    ON o.orderid = od.orderid

    ON od.productid = p.productid
GROUP BY e.firstname, e.lastname, e.employeeid

FROM suppliers as s
INNER JOIN products as p
    ON s.supplierid = p.supplierid
GROUP BY s.suppliername
